#Project TOMB
    The One Mission Builder (TOMB) is a project used to aid in the collection of artifacts for forwarding into Splunk via SplunkUniversalForwarder.
    TOMB uses WMI calls against either single host, or a Domain. Modules can be ran via TOMB.ps1 or by themselves once you import the module you wish to use.
    TOMB utilizes a build and breakdown method which is used in an effort to keep hosts resources free, and avoid overloading of the PSModule.

##Prerequisits
```PowerShell Version 2.0+
Active Directory (RSAT)
SplunkUniversalForwarder```

##Installing
```TOMB does not require installing to run the script, in the future a compile script will be written to setup required file structures.
In order to forward collections into Splunk a UniversalForwarder needs to be installed on host that will run these scripts. Technology Add-on(TA) 
for parsing collection and baselining fields is coming (Currently in development)```

##Usages
###Running modules via TOMB.ps1
Execute modules for Process, Service, EventLog, Registry and Signatures against the domain foo.bar using internal DNS 1.1.1.1
``` .\TOMB.ps1 -Domain "DC=foo,DC=bar" -Server 1.1.1.1 -Collects Process,Service,EventLog,Registry,Signatures```
Execute modules for Process, Service against single host with foo.bar domain using internal DNS 1.1.1.1
``` .\TOMB.ps1 -Server 1.1.1.1 -Computer computer.foo.bar -Collects Process,Service```
###Running modules without TOMB.ps1
Executing TOMB-Process.psm1 against multiple hosts
``` Import-Module .\TOMB-Process.psm1; TOMB-Process -Computer 1.foo.bar,2.foo.bar,3.foo.bar```
Executing TOMB-Process.psm1 against single host
``` Import-Module .\TOMB-Process.psm1; TOMB-Process -Computer 1.foo.bar```
` * NOTE: At this time modules are not setup to run against entire domains *`
