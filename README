README
    The One Mission Builder (TOMB) is a project used to aid in the collection of artifacts for forwarding into Splunk via SplunkUniversalForwarder.
    TOMB uses WMI calls against either single host, or a Domain. Modules can be ran via TOMB.ps1 or by themselves once you import the module you wish to use.
    TOMB utilizes a build and breakdown method which is used in an effort to keep hosts resources free, and avoid overloading of the PSModule.
